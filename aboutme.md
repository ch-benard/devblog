* Currently, I'm a web developer for [La Fabrique Numérique](https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/fabrique-numerique), the french state digital services incubator. I used to work as a developer fot about 15 years. In 2014, I worked as a system & network administrator for the CEREMA, a french public institution. In 2016, I went to the french Ministry of ecology [Ministère de la transition écologique et solidaire](https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr).

* I enjoy writing software tools to help others. In the past several years I've become an experienced Java and PHP developer.

* When I'm not busy with coding, I like to repair and have fun with vintage tech devices. I (try to) make funny or usefull things with Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. I like to spend time with my friends and family. I spend cool moments entertaining the pond where my Koï fishes live. I enjoy music and play both guitar and bass in a band. I'm addicted to water sports (surf, wakeboard). I also like to share and to meet new people :)

* The projects page is a nice place to see some of my skills, but you can also view my resume.

* Grew up in Noth of France; worked in Montpellier (south) where I spent 14 years; moved to Nantes in 2014.

* I currently live near Nantes with my girlfriend, and soon with my daughter.
